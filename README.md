# Computational-Logic-Portfolio

This repository consists of projects i was given during my internship at CODSOFT. It features a series of Java applications developed to solve diverse logic-based challenges, ranging from algorithmic games to financial transaction management.


## 🛠️ Project Modules

### 1. FinTrack Lite: Banking Interface
A console-based application demonstrating the fundamentals of secure financial data handling.
* **Logic:** Implements deposit/withdrawal validation and real-time balance tracking.
* **Tech:** Java (Encapsulation and Exception Handling).

### 2. Scholastic-Metric: Grade Calculator
An automated tool for calculating student performance based on multi-subject input.
* **Logic:** Features automated percentage calculation and grade mapping (A-F) based on institutional standards.
* **Tech:** Java (Conditional Logic and Formatting).

### 3. Cipher-Match: Number Logic Game
An interactive algorithmic game designed to test user input against randomized system-generated values.
* **Logic:** Implements limit-based attempts and proximity feedback logic.
* **Tech:** Java (Scanner API and Random Class).

## 🚀 Technical Highlights
* **Clean Code:** Adherence to Java naming conventions and modular method structures.
* **Robust Input Handling:** Utilizing `Scanner` and `Try-Catch` to ensure user input doesn't crash the application.
* **Mathematical Precision:** Accurate handling of floating-point arithmetic for financial and academic calculations.
